description,string,"Capecitabine, USP is an oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with antineoplastic activity. White powder. Supplied as 150mg (light peach) and 500mg (peach) film-coated tablets.",Description of the drug.
clinical_pharmacology,string,"Mechanism: Metabolized to 5-FU, which inhibits DNA synthesis (via thymidylate synthase) and interferes with RNA processing. Pharmacodynamics: AUC linked to hyperbilirubinemia. Pharmacokinetics: Details absorption (food effect), distribution, metabolism (via DPD), excretion, specific populations, DPD deficiency risks, drug interactions.",Information about the clinical pharmacology of the drug.
mechanism_of_action,string,"Prodrug metabolized to fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU metabolites (FdUMP, FUTP) cause cell injury by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS), thus DNA synthesis, and by incorporating into RNA, interfering with RNA processing and protein synthesis.",Detailed mechanism of action of the drug.
pharmacokinetics,string,"Absorption: Oral, Tmax ~1.5-2h; food decreases Cmax/AUC. Distribution: Protein binding <60%. Metabolism: Converted to 5-FU via multiple steps including DPD enzyme. Elimination: Half-life ~0.75h; primarily renal excretion as metabolites (FBAL). Specific Populations: Adjust dose for renal impairment (CLcr 30-50 mL/min); effect of hepatic impairment noted.","Information on the drug's pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion)."
clinical_studies,string,"Summarizes efficacy data from key trials: X-ACT (adjuvant colon, non-inferior to 5-FU/LV), SO14695/SO14796 (metastatic colorectal), SO14999 (metastatic breast combo w/ docetaxel, improved TTP/OS vs docetaxel alone), SO14697 (metastatic breast single agent).
